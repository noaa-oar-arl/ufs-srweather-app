    This test is to ensure that the workflow running in community mode
    completes successfully on the RRFS_CONUS_25km grid using the HRRR
    physics suite with ICs and LBCs derived from the FV3GFS.
    Additionally, this test deactivates the write component (QUILTING=False)
    to test the workflow's support for this option. Note that run_post and
    subsequent tasks are deactivated as well, since these do not work on the
    native grid output at this time.
