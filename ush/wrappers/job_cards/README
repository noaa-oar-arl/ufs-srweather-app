Here are included examples of job cards for two different workload managers:
Slurm (sbatch) and PBS (qsub).
Each directory containds examples of job cards for seven different tasks:
get_ics, get_lbcs, make_grid, make_ics, make_lbcs, make_orog, make_sfc_climo,
run_fcst and run_post.

Some machines have slightly different commands and examples of these differences are 
included inside each job card sample.

When using Rocoto workflow, you can find printout of your particular
job card in log files. For that print make sure to use -v option when
invoking rocoto commands (rocotorun, rocotorewind, rocotoboot, ...).
