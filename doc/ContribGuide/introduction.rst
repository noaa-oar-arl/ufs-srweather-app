Authoritative Branch
----------------------

The ``ufs-srweather-app`` repository maintains a main branch for development called ``develop``. The HEAD of ``develop`` reflects the latest development changes. It points to regularly updated hashes for individual subcomponents. Pull requests (PRs) are typically merged to ``develop``. 

The ``develop`` branch is protected by the code management team:

   #. Pull requests for this branch require approval by at least two code reviewers.
   #. A code manager should perform at least one of the reviews and the merge, but other contributors are welcome to provide comments/suggestions.
